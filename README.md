Project 1 - Dinner Meal Planning API

For this team project, we needed to create an application where it takes a little bit of everything that we have learned from the last seven weeks. Some of those things are html, CSS, CSS framework (besides bootstrap), JavaScript, and two web API calls.

We needed two server-side web API calls. We originally wanted to use Europeana and Navitia and create an itinerary for european museums (How to get to one museum to another museum). We thought the concept was interesting. However we had issues with Europeana because we couldn't get the name of the museum.

So we scratch the idea and decided to go with something that is simpler and something we all like to do, which is to eat. Not only do we like to eat, but we also like to try new recipes and drinks.

Our favoriate meal time is dinner and so we decided to create a weekly dinner meal planner API tracker. The application will be making calls to Spoonacular and CocktailDB.

We used Bulma as the CSS framework. It created nice divs for each day of the week. Within those divs, we have a search function where when you enter a name of meal or a drink, a list appears. 

When you choose the meal you want, then you are presented with the recipe. What you choose is also saved to local storage so you if you refresh, it won't change.

For future developments, I think this application has potential if we also add a breakfast and lunch. Believe it not, but people love a routine and also keep track of what they eat. I feel like if we to make the application have a combination of a blog, calendar, calorie tracker, that would increase the userbase. I also think if you want to store your own recipe and pictures, the application should give you that option as well. 

Food and drinking is part of everyday life. If you go internet, ther are all sorts of kind of videos or shows of what people doing with food. I think this application has the potential to give influencers a voice and shares there routine and cooking idea.
